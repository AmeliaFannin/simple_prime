simple_prime
============

a simple prime generator in Go

This is my first custom package in Go. 
Though not the most efficient sieve out there, I think it will be useful in solving Project Eulers. 
You can pass in a max or limit, and the PrimeGenerate function returns a channel of prime integers. 

Try it out, if you make some improvements or have suggestions, please get in touch.
